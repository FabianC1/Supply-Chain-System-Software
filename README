How to run the software:

First of all, the code needs to be complied. So in the CLI, run the "make clean" to remove the temporary .o files, and then input "make". It will compile all of the files and classes.
After that, simply type this " ./supply_chain_system.exe games.txt". 

It is crucial that you write the txt file with the exe, as the software uses it as a parameter when it starts up.
